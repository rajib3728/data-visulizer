 Data Visualizer:

In our daily life, we generate a lot of data. Many company search patterns inside data and deliver the right content to the right person. But in the normal eye, maximum data is just a number if we visualize them then we can find a pattern inside them easily. In Python, there is one beautiful library present for representing data in a graphical format called Matplotlib. There is one dedicated software present called MATLAB that can produce graphs from data. But that is a huge software. But if you search then you can see all data scientists and data engineers love python.

If I talk about data visualizer it is also made by the python library Matplolib, Tkinter, and Mysql connector. As I previously discussed that Matplotlib can represent data in a graphical format. Tkinter is also a python library used for making graphical user interfaces (GUI). And MySQL connector is used for making connections between python and MySQL databases.

The actual work of this project is it can fetch data from MySQL database and represent the data into graphical format.
